## Requirements of the Project

This project had several requirements, including: 
- Portfolio with your name, a profile image or avatar (I chose an avatar and made my initials part of the page's header, though I do list my name several times in the content).
- Scrolling links to several sections: "About", "Work", and "Contact". I also added "Resume" and allow the download of a PDF version of my resume.
- Linked Images to projects. I currently only have Run Buddy as a project, but I may add others later - leading to the secondary creation of a "coming-soon" page.
- Mobile-friendly design and media queries. (I only distinquished between two minimum sizes, as I tried to make the initial designs as mobile-friendly as possible anyway, just to make up for the variety in device sizes.)

## Additional Items
- Background image in the Header/Nav bar - just to give everything an Art Deco/floral look. 
- Downloadable PDF of my resume. 
- A "Coming-Soon" page in lieu of a 404.
- Contact Form that opens your email application to send me a message. 
- Links to my social sites.
- Transparency on Hover over images.
- Corners of containers have shadows and colors, creating a "boxed/cornered look" to the content.
